### Pitch

Turning dashcam footage into real-time, geo-tagged road maintenance reports with AI.


### Problem statement
Urban road infrastructure issues often go unreported or are detected too late, leading to accidents, vehicle damage, and inefficient maintenance workflows.

RoadScan AI addresses this by using AI-powered computer vision to automatically detect road hazards from dashcam or smartphone footage, geo-tag incidents, and generate actionable maintenance tickets in real time — enabling faster response and smarter city management.
